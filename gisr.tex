\subsubsection{2D Boundaries}

Due to the basic algorithm of TRACMASS, at boundaries within the numerical domain, drifters will be stopped according to the bounding fluxes. For a given grid cell in the 2D case, there are four fluxes controlling a drifter's movement. Drifters have nonzero fluxes on active sides of the cell and zero fluxes along masked land. They can run along these walls but should not penetrate them. At open numerical boundaries, the drifters will be stopped according to a check built into tracmass itself, and will be left with their final position along the open boundary and a flag indicating that they have exited the domain so they will not be stepped forward.

The addition of subgrid turbulence parameterizations can affect this. One method is to add parameterized turbulent values to the fluxes used to calculate drifter movements. These do not affect the fact that fluxes will be zero at masked land because they are multiplied by the original ufluxes to get the fluctuation to add to the original flux values.

However, there are two methods of adding in a random walk to the particle positions directly, and these were affecting the boundary behavior of drifters near walls. The problem was that when a drifter was alongside a masked land cell, if the random new position of the drifter was just right to move the drifter from its current cell into the land cell, then an error check later in the code for the volume of the cell would catch the drifter (due to its cell having zero volume since it was on land) and the drifter would be stopped at its location near land. Since drifters in the advection-only and turbulent velocity methods do not hit land, the overall behavior was different along the coastline for the diffusion and anisodiffusion methods (in these methods, many more drifters were congregated alongshore). I changed this by adding a check in the diffusion subroutine in tracmass to not accept a new displacement location for a drifter if the layer thickness (dzt) of that new location is zero. Now, I think that all of the routines will have similar coastline behavior. If, on the other hand, it is desired that drifters should be able to hit the coastline and ``beach,'' then this behavior in the diffusion routines might be desired.

% Diffusion parameters and number of interpolation steps
\subsection{Examine Sensivity of Results to Input Parameters}

A series of numerical surface drifter experiments were run for 16 days forward in time from 11/20/2009 with several changing parameters to understand their importance to the results.

There is little overall difference for the number of time interpolation steps for these simulations (not shown).

The difference in the results from diffusion types is illustrated in Figure \ref{diffusiontype}. For numerical drifter experiments with drifters initially seeded 10 km apart and using the same horizontal diffusivity, the difference in tracks and final positions is not extreme, but is noticeable. The cases with no diffusion and parameterized turbulent velocities (Figures \ref{diffusiontype-none} and \ref{diffusiontype-turb}) are similar, though a larger value of $A_H$ would presumably change this more. The cases with a random walk-type diffusion added to the particle tracks themselves (Figures \ref{diffusiontype-aniso} and \ref{diffusiontype-diff}) show more diffused behavior and are fairly similar to each other.
