#GISR: TX-LA shelf drifter tracking

The run.py script will take care of the command call details, including distribution to available cores on a Linux machine and writing to a log file. Run the GISR project and save the standard output to a log file at the command prompt with `python run.py` with flags following this base command. The flag options are references to the subprojects that you want to run and available options can be found in run.py. These flags should be specified by prefixing the project name with '--'. For example: `python run.py --sensitivity --galv_b --compile` to run the sensitivity and backward Galveston Bay subproject, and then compile the Latex document. This has only been run using Python version 2.7.
